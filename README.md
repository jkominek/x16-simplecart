# Simple Cartridge Tutorial for the Commander X16

So you'd like to make your own cartridge. You'll need a circuit,
and a circuit board. (And then stuff to put on it.)

What we've got here is a PDF with a schematic. You can replicate it
yourself in KiCad, tweaking it to suit your needs, and then use the
use footprints in my (KiCad
library)[https://github.com/jkominek/x16expansion] to lay out the PCB
quickly and easily.

Or you can go over to the (releases
section)[https://github.com/jkominek/x16simplecart/releases) and grab
some Gerber files that you can upload to JLCPCB. You can't change those,
though. They're licensed CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, so you can have them made
for yourself, and only yourself. No group buys, no taking my name out
of the silkscreen and selling them on eBay, etc, etc.
